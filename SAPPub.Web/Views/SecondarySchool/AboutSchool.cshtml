                <p>
                    Special educational needs (SEN) units and resourced provisions are specialist provisions in mainstream schools formally recognised by the local authority.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In SEN units pupils are taught within separate classes for at least half of their time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In resourced provisions, pupils are taught within mainstream classes for at least half of their time, but have access to a base and specialist facilities around the school.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They are both for pupils with SEN, who typically have education, health, and care (EHC) plans.
