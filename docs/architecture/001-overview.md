# Architectural Overview

This overview provides an at-a-glance view of the SAP Public service and it's idealised workings. 

This document and section is due to change, due to a want to implement more "Clean Architecture" so deemed a WIP document.

Summary of responsibilities:

- **SAPPub.Web**: Hosts the user-facing site and HTTP endpoints. Contains controllers, Views, and middleware.
- **SAPPub.Core**: Application core — entities, service interfaces, business logic. Keeps domain logic independent of frameworks.
- **SAPPub.Infrastructure**: Implements `Core` interfaces (repositories, data access), third-party integrations, and persistence concerns.
- **SAPData**: Tools and scripts used to generate and transform source data and SQL artifacts used by the application.
- **Tests/**: Unit and integration test projects; run CI validations from here.
- **docs/**: Documentation templates, architecture decisions (ADRs), and operational runbooks.
- **terraform/**: IaC for provisioning environments; usually environment-specific modules live here.
- **global_config/**: Shell scripts and environment-level config helpers (e.g., `production.sh`, `test.sh`).

At-a-glance flow:

```
User -> SAPPub.Web (HTTP) -> Core services -> Infrastructure (DB, Repos)
				^
				|-- Integration points (SAPData import, external services)
```

How to read this section:

- Use the tree above to locate a component quickly.
- Open `SAPPub.Core` to find domain types and service contracts.
- Open `SAPPub.Infrastructure` to see concrete implementations wired in at startup.
- Use `SAPData` when examining data-generation and SQL artifacts.
